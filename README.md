👋 Hi, I’m Abdou, an experienced Flutter developer with a strong interest in AI, databases, and web development. I'm continually expanding my skills and knowledge in these areas to create well-rounded applications and solutions.

🌱 I’m currently deepening my understanding of databases and web development technologies, including database design, SQL, web frameworks, and front-end and back-end development.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve integrating Flutter with web technologies, databases, and AI to build powerful and feature-rich applications.

📫 You can reach me through my GitHub profile: just-abdou. Feel free to connect, and let's explore the exciting world of Flutter, databases, web development, and AI together!
